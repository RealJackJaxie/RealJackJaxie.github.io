### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1, was one of my favorites because it was one of the first labs I have done in this class and because this was very similar to something I have done in Python. In high school, I worked with Python, which was also one of my first assignments. I really liked this lab because it was simple but also had a bit of difficulty, but luckily the whole formula was given to us, and it made it easier. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3, was one of my favorites because the difficulty and reward proved greatness. This was one of the first labs that took a considerable amount of time to complete. It took several hours to fix a couple of problems, and when it finally worked, it felt great because I knew I had done that. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3, was one of my favorites because it was the first one that actually created an image with interesting effects. In high school we could make visuals in Python, but we never did anything like the image in this lab. It was also interesting by the way we made images, it was another boiler plate and new header, whereas Python just has everything built into it already.
